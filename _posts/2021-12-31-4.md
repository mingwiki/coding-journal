# Handling User Agent Styles

To inform the browser UA stylesheet about the system color scheme preferences and tell it which color schemes are supported in the page, we can use the color-scheme meta tag.
```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="dark light">
```
We can also set this in CSS:
```css
:root {
  color-scheme: light dark; /* both supported */
}
```
